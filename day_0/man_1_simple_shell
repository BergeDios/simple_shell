.SH Invocation
An
.I interactive
simple shell can be invoked by typing ./shell. Meanwhile, a
.I non-interactive
simple shell can also be invoked via a pipe (e.g. echo "/bin/ls" | ./shell).

.SS Command Execution
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.
.sp
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name that function is invoked. If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.
.sp
If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, the simple shell searches each element of the environmental variable PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name. If the search is unsuccessful, the simple shell prints an error message "Error Command"
